The Neo Editor
==============

Neo is an open source 3D game engine for creating stunning video games and simulations for Linux, Windows and Android. The goal of this project is to create an easy to use but powerful tool for you to create the games you want by using the best software available in the world of open source.

Compilation
===========

Neo uses a CMake based build system for creating IDE projects, Makefiles and packages for various Linux distributions and Windows. Simply use CMake to create the buildsystem and compile using the generated project/Makefile.
This version uses LuaJIT as the standard LUA solution.
You can compile the engine to use Lua instead of LuaJIT by adding "-DSTANDARD_LUA=true" to your CMake call.

Terms and conditions
====================

This project is free software. Free not as in "free beer" but as in "free speech". That means that the four fundamental freedoms are granted to you as the user.

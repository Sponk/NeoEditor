openal-soft-1.16.0:

    Implemented EFX Chorus, Flanger, Distortion, Equalizer, and Compressor
    effects.

    Implemented high-pass and band-pass EFX filters.

    Implemented the high-pass filter for the EAXReverb effect.

    Implemented SSE2 and SSE4.1 linear resamplers.

    Implemented Neon-enhanced non-HRTF mixers.

    Implemented a QSA backend, for QNX.

    Implemented the ALC_SOFT_pause_device, AL_SOFT_deferred_updates,
    AL_SOFT_block_alignment, AL_SOFT_MSADPCM, and AL_SOFT_source_length
    extensions.

    Fixed resetting mmdevapi backend devices.

    Fixed clamping when converting 32-bit float samples to integer.

    Fixed modulation range in the Modulator effect.

    Several fixes for the OpenSL playback backend.

    Fixed device specifier names that have Unicode characters on Windows.

    Added support for filenames and paths with Unicode (UTF-8) characters on
    Windows.

    Added support for alsoft.conf config files found in XDG Base Directory
    Specification locations (XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and XDG_CONFIG_HOME, or their
    defaults) on non-Windows systems.

    Added a GUI configuration utility (requires Qt 4.8).

    Added support for environment variable expansion in config options (not
    keys or section names).

    Added an example that uses SDL2 and ffmpeg.

    Modified examples to use SDL_sound.

    Modified CMake config option names for better sorting.

    HRTF data sets specified in the hrtf_tables config option may now be
    relative or absolute filenames.

    Made the default HRTF data set an external file, and added a data set for
    48khz playback in addition to 44.1khz.

    Added support for C11 atomic methods.

    Improved support for some non-GNU build systems.

openal-soft-1.15.1:

    Fixed a regression with retrieving the source's AL_GAIN property.

openal-soft-1.15:

    Fixed device enumeration with the OSS backend.

    Reorganized internal mixing logic, so unneeded steps can potentially be
    skipped for better performance.

    Removed the lookup table for calculating the mixing pans. The panning is
    now calculated directly for better precision.

    Improved the panning of stereo source channels when using stereo output.

    Improved source filter quality on send paths.

    Added a config option to allow PulseAudio to move streams between devices.

    The PulseAudio backend will now attempt to spawn a server by default.

    Added a workaround for a DirectSound bug relating to float32 output.

    Added SSE-based mixers, for HRTF and non-HRTF mixing.

    Added support for the new AL_SOFT_source_latency extension.

    Improved ALSA capture by avoiding an extra buffer when using sizes
    supported by the underlying device.

    Improved the makehrtf utility to support new options and input formats.

    Modified the CFLAGS declared in the pkg-config file so the "AL/" portion of
    the header includes can optionally be omitted.

    Added a couple example code programs to show how to apply reverb, and
    retrieve latency.

    The configuration sample is now installed into the share/openal/ directory
    instead of /etc/openal.

    The configuration sample now gets installed by default.
